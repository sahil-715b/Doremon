  <h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>

  <p>
    This application is a private webhook listener for Instagram, used solely for testing and automation purposes by the developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app does <strong>not collect, store, or process</strong> any personal data, media, or messages from users. It listens to real-time Instagram events like comments, mentions, and messages, but it does not store any of this data in any database or external service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, there is <strong>no user data to delete</strong> â€” nothing is permanently stored by this application at any point.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    If you believe your data has been collected by mistake, or you have specific concerns, you can still contact the developer:
  </p>

  <p>
    ðŸ“§ Email: <a href="mailto:sahilk11167@gmail.com">sahilk11167@gmail.com</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Please mention your Instagram username and describe your concern clearly.
  </p>
